Power BI Report for Student Survey Analysis </br>
Project Overview </br>
The objective of this project is to analyze the student survey data to extract meaningful insights by creating a Power BI report. The data set consists of information about the amount spent by students on different types of purchases like video games, indoor games, toys, books, and gadgets. The data set also includes the store setting column that explains the type of location in which the store is present. The report includes tabular visualization, matrix visualization, funnel chart, pie chart, scatter plot, sand dance plot, and Q&A feature of Power BI.

Report Details </br>
Tabular Visualization: The tabular visualization displays the total amount of purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store setting’. The records are formatted based on the amount spent as follows: </br>
If 0<TAP<35000, then records should be in red colour </br>
If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records should be in yellow colour </br>
If TAP>=60000, then records should be in Blue colour </br>
Matrix Visualization: The matrix visualization displays the amount spent on outdoor sports across different ages and ‘Store setting’. The amount spent in total outdoor sports is colour-formatted. </br>

Funnel Chart: The funnel chart displays the total amount of purchase by ‘Store setting’. The data labels are shown as Percentage of First. </br>

Pie Chart: The pie chart displays the total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’ for Suburban ‘Store setting’ only. The filter context is used to achieve this. </br>

Scatter Plot: The scatter plot displays the relationship between Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across different ages. </br>

Conclusion </br>
This Power BI report provides insights into the student survey data by using various visualization techniques. The report highlights the relationship between different types of purchases and the store settings. The report also provides data access restriction for different users and a Q&A feature to answer specific questions.
